# Translator Extension for Ulauncher (Ulauncher v5 Support)

## Disclaimer

This extension was originally created for Ulauncher v4. However, this fork has been updated and upgraded to be compatible with Ulauncher v5 and Python 3.

If you're using Ulauncher v5 or higher, this version of the extension should work perfectly. For users on Ulauncher v4, please refer to the original version of the extension.

## In Two Words

A simple translator extension for [Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/) that integrates with [translate-shell](https://github.com/soimort/translate-shell) to provide fast translations right from your desktop.

## Dependencies

You need to install [translate-shell](https://github.com/soimort/translate-shell). The executable must be in your system’s `$PATH` for the extension to work. For example, you can copy the executable to `/bin/` or any other directory that’s included in your `$PATH`.
